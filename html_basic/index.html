    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! This is my very first webpage. I'm excited to start sharing my projects and ideas with the world.</p>

    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>I recently began learning web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build awesome websites.</p>

    <p>In the near future, I plan to add more projects and improve this portfolio. Stay tuned!</p>
    <p>Feel free to connect with me through my social media or email, which I'll add soon.</p>
